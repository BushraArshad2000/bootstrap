            Water is the primary and essential need of every living organism. It is the most precious gift by nature
            that helps in survival. 70% of our body is filled with water, which is why it is an essential part of our
            life. Water is needed for various purposes every day. We need water for drinking, washing, cleaning,
            cooking, etc. Just like there is no life without oxygen, there is no existence without water. It exists in
            the form of seas, oceans, etc., and also in the form of ice. It is not only an essential element for human
            beings but also crucial for the survival and existence of plants, animals, birds, etc.

            Paragraph on Water in 150 Words
            Water is the most important component of life, which is needed by human beings and needed for animals,
            birds, trees, etc. It exists in three different forms on the earth, i.e., solid, liquid, and gas. Water
            exists in the form of ice (solid), and water vapour (gaseous) forms. It also exists in the form of liquid in
            the seas, oceans, rivers, etc., but the composition of water remains the same throughout the earth. It is an
            important compound that is needed by all living organisms. Plants need water for photosynthesis, and humans
            need water for various purposes like cooking, bathing, washing, etc. So, like oxygen is an essential
            component for survival, water is also a crucial component of life.

            Even though 3/4th part of the earth is covered by water, the amount of freshwater is low. Since the amount
            of freshwater is comparatively lower, it is necessary to conserve water by various means. For a healthy
            life, it is essential to drink the right quantity and quality of water.

            Paragraph on Water in 200 Words
            Water plays a vital role in one’s life. It is required not just for our own survival but also for the proper
            functioning of our planet. All fruits and vegetables contain abundant water in them. To stay healthy, it is
            needed to have plenty of water, i.e., approximately 3–4 litres of water per day. The human body needs water,
            and a lack of it can result in major health problems. Kidney stones are a serious health problem caused by
            insufficient water consumption. Water has the ability to heal and is necessary for life to exist. Our planet
            is the only place where life is conceivable since water and all of the other essential elements for life are
            present. Planets, such as Mars, Mercury, and Venus, are uninhabitable. They resemble a desolate desert since
            there is no water. Water is necessary for life, and it also helps to keep the environment clean.
